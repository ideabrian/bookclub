### There are six (6) basic types of values in JavaScript
+numbers
+strings
+Booleans
+objects
+functions
+undefined values

To create a value, you merely invoke its name.

JavaScript uses 64 bits to store a single number value.

For N decimal digits, the upper limit of numbers that can be represented is 10 to the N
Given 63 binary digits, you can represent 2 to the 64 or about 18 quintillion (18 zeroes)

NaN - Not a number - even though it is a value of the number type. Results when your calcultions don't yield a precise, meaningful result.
